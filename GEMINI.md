The navigation bar was overlapping with the main content on scroll. This was fixed by increasing the `padding-top` of the `body` element in `css/main.css` to `100px` to accommodate the height of the fixed navigation bar.

The navigation bar was also transparent. This was fixed by uncommenting the CSS variables in `css/main.css` to apply the dark theme, which includes an opaque background for the navigation bar.
