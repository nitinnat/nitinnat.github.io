        # This assumes your GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.
        # If it's configured to deploy from `master` (or `main`) branch's `/docs` folder,
        # or the root of `master` (or `main`), you might need to adjust `publish_branch`.
        # For typical User/Organization Pages, `master` (or `main`) branch is often used.
        # If your site is `username.github.io`, it usually deploys from `master` (or `main`).
        # If it's a Project Page, it often deploys from `gh-pages` or `master/docs`.
        # I will assume `gh-pages` for now, but you may need to change this to `master` or `main`.
