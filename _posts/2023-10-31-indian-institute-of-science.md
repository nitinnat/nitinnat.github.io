### Summer Research Intern (Computer Vision)
*May 2014 - July 2014 (3 months)*

Compared various feature extraction and supervised learning methods for Offline Optical Character Recognition (under Dr. Rathna G.N.):

- Worked on various facets of Image Processing involving Image Acquisition/ Retrieval; Image Pre- processing and Feature Extraction methods( Principal Component Analysis, Local Binary Patterns, Convex Hulls, Image Metrics, Discrete Cosine Transforms).
- Studied and applied Supervised Learning Algorithms ( Nearest Neighbours, One-vs-all SVM) on the acquired and processed character data set to conduct a thorough analysis of different feature extraction methods versus the cross-validation accuracy.
- Used MATLAB to develop the algorithms along with a front-end GUI as a practical implementation

### Summer Research Intern (Embedded Systems)
*May 2013 - July 2013 (3 months)*

Design of an AVR based Oscilloscope(under Dr. Rathna G.N.):

Designed an AVR microcontroller-based Oscilloscope to measure and visualize electrical signals, comprising filter circuits, embedded C programming on AVR Studio using the Atmega-8 microcontroller, culminating in a Matlab GUI for visualization.
