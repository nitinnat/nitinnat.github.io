### Graduate Research Assistant
*September 2018 - May 2019 (9 months)*

Worked on cursor detection and tracking in Adobe Photoshop videos, in collaboration with Adobe Research.

Implemented a fully unsupervised method that incorporated adaptive video-based cursor discovery; multi-scale template matching; and optimal path search to locate the highest scoring cursor trajectory in the entire video.

Other methods that were tried, included Optical Flow, Deep Visual Embeddings and Transfer Learning. Our method is able to discover previously unseen mouse cursors in videos, despite fast movement and instant appearance changes in a fully unsupervised manner. It outperforms Online Tracking (TLD, CSRT, MIL), and Deep Learning based object detection methods (Faster-RCNN) which require large training datasets.

Tools: Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow, NetworkX

### Student Research Assistant
*September 2017 - November 2018 (1 year 3 months)*

Over the course of the last year as a research assistant for Prof. Haimonti Dutta, I have worked on a variety of problems related to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
These include:
1. GADGET - A gossip-based sub-gradient solver, which aims to determine a solution for the binary
classification SVM in a distributed setting. I worked on several improvements for an existing code-
base, ran baseline experiments, wrote scripts to aggregate results, and performed a literature review.
I am now working towards converting the whole code-base into Java, using the Pegasos-SVM code
available within the WEKA library as a foundation.
Tech stack - Java, C++, Java Native Interface (JNI), Python, Peersim (A distributed simulator).
2. Named Entity Recognition on tweets. Tech stack: Java, StanfordNLP.
3. Vanilla, Lasso and Ridge Logistic Regression for the problem of detecting inter-group prejudice in
tweets. Tech stack: R
