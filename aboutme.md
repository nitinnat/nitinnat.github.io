title: About me
---

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at o9 Solutions working on Generative AI, LLMs and Agentic Workflows. I have also previously worked on time series forecasting and machine learning algorithms for large scale data. I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, where I worked on Computer Vision and Federated ML.

I've previously interned at Clarifai where I worked on computer vision with depth cameras, and at Fidelity Investments where I built dashboards and chatbots.
