# About Me

I build production GenAI systems at o9 Solutions. Currently focused on agentic workflows with LLMs, RAG architectures, document ingestion pipelines, and the infrastructure that makes these systems work at scale. I work on interesting problems in the GenAI engineering layer - effective API design, context and memory management for long conversations, making non-deterministic systems debuggable, prompt design, agent behavior evaluation in production, hierarchical memory systems, and making LLM applications observable.

Before GenAI, I spent years building AutoML systems for time series forecasting at retail scale, processing terabytes of data for 10,000+ locations using PySpark and Hadoop for distributed training. Worked on the full ML infrastructure stack: big data pipelines, model serving APIs, monitoring systems, hyperparameter optimization, automated retraining. Earlier in grad school, I did research in computer vision (unsupervised cursor tracking with Adobe Research) and federated learning (distributed SVM training without centralizing data). I have an MS in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, where I specialized in computer vision and distributed machine learning.

### Graduate Research Assistant
**University at Buffalo** · *September 2018 - May 2019*

![Cursor Tracking System](/assets/cursor_tracking.png)

Collaborated with Adobe Research on cursor detection and tracking in screen recording videos. Built an unsupervised approach combining adaptive template discovery, multi-scale matching, and optimal path algorithms.

### Mouse Cursor Detection and Tracking in Instructional Videos

**Abstract:** Many expert users of particular software, e.g. Adobe Photoshop regularly post instructional videos online, imparting knowledge on how to perform certain tasks. An important feature that can be used to understand the instructor's actions in an instructional video, is to detect and track the mouse cursor throughout the entirety of each video. Despite recent progress of object detection and tracking, identifying the mouse cursor in such videos is a unique and difficult problem since the mouse cursor typically occupies a very small percentage of the entire frame (0.05-1%), exhibits fast movement, and is prone to instant appearance changes and background clutter. We propose a novel three-step tracking-by-detection approach for mouse cursor detection and tracking: unsupervised cursor discovery, multi-scale template matching, and optimal spatiotemporal path search. Our approach is completely unsupervised and is able to handle instant appearance changes and fast movements of the mouse cursor. We present evaluations on a dataset of annotated Adobe Photoshop instructional videos, and show that our method beats conventional online tracking methods such as TLD, MIL and CSRT trackers by a large margin. For a more fair comparison, we also compare our results with Faster-RCNN, a deep learning based object detector, and show comparable success rates.

![Consensus Based Vertically Partitioned MLPs](/assets/consensus_mlp_vertical.png)

**Abstract:** Storing large volumes of data on distributed devices has become commonplace in recent years. Applications involving sensors capture data in different modalities including image, video, audio, GPS and others. Novel distributed algorithms are required to learn from this rich, multi-modal data. We present an algorithm for learning consensus based multi-layer perceptrons on resource-constrained devices. Assuming nodes (devices) in the distributed system are arranged in a graph and contain vertically partitioned data and labels, the goal is to learn a global function that minimizes the loss. Each node learns a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron and obtains a loss on data stored locally. It then gossips with a neighbor, chosen uniformly at random, and exchanges information about the loss. The updated loss is used to run a back propagation algorithm and adjust local weights appropriately. This method enables nodes to learn the global function without exchange of data in the network. Empirical results reveal that the consensus algorithm converges to the centralized model and has performance comparable to centralized multi-layer perceptrons and tree-based algorithms.

### GADGET SVM: A Gossip-bAseD sub-GradiEnT Solver for Linear SVMs

![Federated Learning System](/assets/federated_learning.png)

**Abstract:** In the era of big data, an important weapon in a machine learning researcher's arsenal is a scalable Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVMs are extensively used for solving classification problems. Traditional algorithms for learning SVMs often scale super linearly with training set size which becomes infeasible very quickly for large data sets. In recent years, scalable algorithms have been designed which study the primal or dual formulations of the problem. This often suggests a way to decompose the problem and facilitate development of distributed algorithms. We present a distributed algorithm for learning linear Support Vector Machines in the primal form for binary classification called Gossip-bAseD sub-GradiEnT (GADGET) SVM. The algorithm is designed such that it can be executed locally on nodes of a distributed system. Each node processes its local homogeneously partitioned data and learns a primal SVM model. It then gossips with random neighbors about the classifier learnt and uses this information to update the model. Extensive theoretical and empirical results suggest that this anytime algorithm has performance comparable to its centralized and online counterparts.
