# About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at o9 Solutions, where I build generative AI systems, agentic workflows, and scalable ML infrastructure. My work spans large language models, time series forecasting, and distributed machine learning systems that operate at scale.

I earned my Master's in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, specializing in Computer Vision and Federated Machine Learning. Before that, I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka.

My career has taken me from building pre-LLM chatbots at Fidelity to developing computer vision systems at Clarifai, conducting research in federated learning at UB, and now architecting production GenAI systems. I'm interested in the intersection of systems engineering and machine learning—building infrastructure that makes AI practical and scalable.
